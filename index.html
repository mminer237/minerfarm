			<p>Welcome to Miner Farm Storage! We are a small, family-owned storage business in rural Champaign. We offer both vehicle and personal storage, although we are currently only accepting new vehicle storage customers. We would love to store your car, truck, SUV, or boat for as long as you need!</p>
			<h2>Why should you choose Miner Farm Storage?</h2>
			<div class="q">Environment</div>
			<div class="a">Miner Farm Storage offers indoor vehicle storage within our 524-foot long storage building. It does get dusty on the farm though, so a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Full-Exterior-Covers/b/ref=dp_bc_4?ie=UTF8&node=15735581">dust cover</a> may be ideal. Outdoor storage is also available around the farm for longer vehicles such as large boats. See more information at our <a href="photos.html">Photos page</a> or come out for a visit!</div>
			<div class="q">Location</div>
			<div class="a">We are located halfway between Champaign and Mahomet on US-150. This rural area gives us safety and seclusion, while still making us conviniently accessible when needed.

			<div class="q">Longevity</div>
			<div class="a">Miner Farm has been owned and run by the Miner family for almost 200 years. Ever since great-great-grandfather Charles Miner began Miner Farm in 1850, the farm has continually been passed from father to son. It is now run from Dan Miner and family and has no end in sight, giving you peace of mind that you can store your valued possessions for as long as needed.</div>
			<div class="q">Personability</div>
			<div class="a">Being family-run, you can be sure that you will be interacted and treated properly on a personal level. We're not just some faceless corporation, we're here for you. Feel free to <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a> any time!</div>
